ft_ssl [md5] [sha256]
An introduction to cryptographic hashing algorithms

This is the first ft_ssl project on the path of Encryption and Security of the 42 school.

The goal is to emulate the behavior of the MD5 and SHA-256 hashing algorithms,
providing the following flags (for both - [md5] and [sha256]):

• -p, echo STDIN to STDOUT and append the checksum to STDOUT
• -q, quiet mode
• -r, reverse the format of the output.
• -s, print the sum of the given string
